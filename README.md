# Movie Recommendation System - Content-Based Filtering

## Overview
This project is a **Content-Based Filtering Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies similar to a given movie based on its content. The system processes raw movie data, converts it into a structured format, and then uses vectorization techniques to provide recommendations.

## Features

### 1. Content-Based Filtering
Recommends movies similar to a selected movie by analyzing the content of the movies.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
Raw data is cleaned and transformed into meaningful data using advanced data processing techniques.

### 3. Text Processing
Utilizes **NLTK's Porter Stemmer** to remove similar words, enhancing the accuracy of recommendations.

### 4. Vectorization
Converts movie descriptions into vectors, enabling the calculation of cosine similarities between movies.

### 5. Top-N Recommendations
The system returns the **top 5 closest movies** based on the cosine similarity score.

## Libraries and Tools Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for the project.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and transformation.
- **Scikit-learn**: Provides tools for vectorization and calculating cosine similarity.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: Used for text processing, particularly with the Porter Stemmer to standardize similar words.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and documentation.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of movie titles, descriptions, and other relevant metadata. The raw data undergoes several preprocessing steps to ensure it is in a format suitable for analysis and recommendation.


## Fetching Movie Posters using API

You can fetch movie posters using **The Movie Database (TMDB) API**
